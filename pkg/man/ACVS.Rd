\usage{ACVS(x, biased=TRUE, center=TRUE)}
\description{Calculates the autocovariance sequence for an input time series.}

\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector representing a uniformly sampled real-valued time series.}
\item{biased}{a logical value. If \code{TRUE}, the biased estimator (normalized by \eqn{N}, the number of samples in the time series) is returned.
If \code{FALSE}, the result is the unbiased estimator (the kth ACVS value is normalized by \eqn{N - |k|} for
the unbiased case where \eqn{k=0,\ldots,N-1}{k=0,...,N-1}). Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{center}{a logical value. If \code{TRUE}, the series is first centered (sample mean is subtracted
from series) prior to calculating the ACVS. Default: \code{TRUE}.}
}

\value{
a numeric vector containing the single-sided ACVS for lags \eqn{k=0,\ldots,N-1}{k=0,...,N-1} where \eqn{N} is the length
of the input time series.
